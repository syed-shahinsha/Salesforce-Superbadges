Note : All these challenges can be solved in more than way. These logics are just to clarify your doubt when you're stuck in a challenge, do try it out yourself first and check this out if you're still stuck!

Challenge 1:
->	Require to add trigger logic and call updateWorkOrders from helper class
    
Challenge 2:
->	Test the wareHouseCalloutService by executing this code from anonymous window
		ID jobID = System.enqueueJob(new WarehouseCalloutService());
    		System.debug('jobId-'+jobID);

Challenge 3:
->	Once done with WarehouseSyncSchedule class, try executing this bit of code from anonymous window to schedule the service and complete your challenge
		String cronExp = '0 0 1 ? * *'; //set the cronExp based on your challege statement. For me, it was 1am daily
		WarehouseSyncSchedule whSyncSchedule = new WarehouseSyncSchedule();
		System.schedule('WarehouseSyncScheduleJob', cronExp, whSyncSchedule);
		
Challenge 4:
->	Added positive, negative and bulk cases test outcomes

Challenge 5:
->	Added callout service mock and tested service callout with one test which should cover 100% coverage

Challenge 5:
->	Tested scheduling logic with one test which covers 100% code coverage
